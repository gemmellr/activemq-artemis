TODOs not explicitly noted in the code itself already:

- Remove JBL use from last remaining tests etc tests still using it
- Restore the Travis config file
- Delete the old DELETE-ME-logging.properties and DELETE-ME-tests-logging.properties files once all needed comparisons during old test etc config replacements are done.
- Update references to JBL and logging.properties in the documentation
- Decide what if anything should be done around the removed logging config reload bits (Log4J2 enables reload itself, via its own config...or updates via management)
- Decide if we should use the auto-detected log4j2.properties config filename instead
