TODOs not explicitly noted in the code itself already:

- Remove JBL use from last remaining tests etc tests still using it
- Fix stacktraces of generated exceptions not to include the generated 'logmessage' method creating it.
- Replace logging.properties files in remaining tests/examples needing their own custom config
 -- Investigate how ./examples/common/config/logging.properties is used and what to do with it.
- Restore the NettySecurityClientTest and figure out what needs changed to make it work.
- Restore the Travis config file
- Delete the old DELETE-ME-logging.properties and DELETE-ME-tests-logging.properties files once all needed comparisons during old test etc config replacements are done.
- Update references to JBL and logging.properties in the documentation
- Decide what if anything should be done around the removed logging config reload bits (Log4J2 enables reload itself, via its own config...or updates via management)
