TODOs not explicitly noted in the code itself already:

- Remove JBL use from last remaining tests etc tests still using it
- Fix stacktraces of generated exceptions not to include the generated 'logmessage' method creating it.
- Replace logging.config files in remaining tests/examples needing their own custom config
- Restore the NettySecurityClientTest and figure out what needs changed to make it work.
- Restore the Travis config file
- Delete the old DELETE-ME-logging.properties and DELETE-ME-tests-logging.properties files once all needed comparisons during old test etc config replacements are done.
